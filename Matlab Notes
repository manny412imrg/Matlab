MATLAB notes
With the enter key we run the commands
	m = 1 + 2 (Enter)
Matlab store a default variable in the word “ans”
	1+2 (enter)
Ans = 3
Matlab first analyzes the left side of the operation separated by the equality sign
	m = 1 + 2 (enter)
(1 + 2 = 3) => (m = 3)
On the right side there is a window (workspace) with the variables and their values
With the sign ; you can suppress the output of the default value
	m =  1 + 2 (enter)	=> ( m = 3 )				
m = 1 + 2; (enter)	=>  (   )
Variables must start with letters and can only contain numbers, letters, and underscores.
To save a file in Matlab we use the “save” command, for example “save file”, this is saved in .mat format
To change the number of decimal places that can be displayed you can use the format command, for example format long for several characters and format short for only 4 decimal places.
To create arrays, brackets are used and separated by spaces. When you need to create matrixes, you separate them with ; for line breaks
